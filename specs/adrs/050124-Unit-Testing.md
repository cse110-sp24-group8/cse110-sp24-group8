# ADR: Unit Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a tool that can do simple unit testing and whether our functions return correct values/types.

## Considered Options

* Jest

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Using Jest because everyone has some experience using Jest because of the labs. Less of a learning curve for everyone and due to the time crunch. Additionally, not many of us know any other Unit Testing Tools.

## Conclusion

Since the majority have experience with Jest from labs and how similar it is to JUnit testing, Jest is the most comfortable tool for us to conduct unit testing.
