# ADR: Formatting of Code/Files
## Context and Problem Statement

Since we want to have consistent formats of all the files to be the same and have it look as if one person coded the program, we would need a way to check if the files are consistent.

## Considered Options

* Prettier

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We chose to use Prettier as a way to keep our code formatting the same thorughtout our coding process because it can modify our code to be consistent with a particular format whether its spacing or the style we have on our code.

## Conclusion

By using Prettier, our code files will be consistent thorughout the coding process and can be implemented with ESLint to overlook our code. Rather than having someone to check through extensive lines of code to check for consistentcy, Prettier will automatically check for various styling and fixes them.
