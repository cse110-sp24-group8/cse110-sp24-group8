# ADR: Task Division After Finalizing High Fidelity Mockup

## Context and Problem Statement

Following the finalization of the High Fidelity Mockup, the team convened for a standup meeting to discuss the division of tasks and responsibilities for the upcoming work.

## Considered Options

* No Task Allocation
* Specifically Assigning Issues
* Expertise-based issue to groups
* Dividing Divs to Smaller Sections

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Expertise-based task allocation and designating task leads, as it ensures efficient utilization of skills and clear accountability. 

### Task Leads

* **CI/CD Video Lead:** Brandon Luu
* **ADR Assignment Lead:** KP and Kevin Kuang

### Expertise-Based Task Allocation

* **Joshua's Team:** Code Log and Team Calendar
* **Kevin's Team:** Dashboard and SideBar
* **KP's Team:** Task List and Feedback
* **Nick's Team:** Documentation

## Next Steps

Teams will collaborate within their respective domains, with designated leads ensuring progress tracking and timely completion of tasks. Regular check-ins will be conducted to monitor progress and address any blockers.

Each team lead will create my specific issues
to further split up the tasks into smaller sections. The targeted deadline is 12pm on Wednesday, 15th May, so that we can show an initial completed skeleton structure to our Team Mentor Jash Makhija 
for review.

## Conclusion

By allocating tasks based on expertise and designating task leads, the team aims to streamline work processes and maintain accountability, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the project objectives.
