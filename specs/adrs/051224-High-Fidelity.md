# ADR: High Fidelity

## Context and Problem Statement

During the team meeting, we wanted to develop a general design and decide on which key features are needed for our Journal

## Considered Options

* Notes, comments, text area for daily summary
* Code blocks for editing details
* Labels for offline functionality
* Calendar and task list for workflow development
* Conflict resolution support
* Use of local storage/cache
* Data conversion to JSON or other formats for offline use
* Meeting minutes templates
* Flowchart templates for task breakdown
* Focus on local features first
* Templates and guide maps implementation
* Minimum features: code blocks and labels
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Have Calendar, Task List, Code Log, Feedback, and Documentation Features

## Next Steps

Teams will decide on which feature to work on and collaborate within their respective domains to start implementing the skeleton structure of each feature.

## Conclusion

By narrowing the features down and having a high fidelity model of the webapp, we will know what we will need to implement and split up the work.
