# ADR: Focus Themes, Solutions, and Competitors

## Context and Problem Statement

In our recent team discussions, we identified five key themes that pose significant challenges in software development: Continuity between Work, Developing a Workflow, Personal Issues/Conflicts/Documentation, Testing and Maintenance, and Resources for Help. Each of these themes encompasses a range of difficulties that developers encounter, impacting productivity, collaboration, and overall project success. Additionally, we brainstormed potential solutions for each theme and selected competitors for analysis to gain insights into industry best practices.

## Considered Options

* Identify key focus themes
* Brainstorm potential solutions for each theme
* Select competitors for analysis (Teams, Slack, Notion, Github, etc.)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: Identifying focus themes, brainstorming solutions, and selecting competitors for analysis.

### Focus Themes

1. Continuity between Work
2. Developing a Workflow
3. Personal Issues/Conflicts/Documentation
4. Testing and Maintenance
5. Resources for Help

### Potential Solutions

#### Continuity between Work:
1. Implement version control systems.
2. Establish clear handover processes.

#### Developing a Workflow:
1. Integrate project management tools.
2. Implement Agile methodologies.

#### Personal Issues/Conflicts/Documentation:
1. Foster a positive work culture and sense of belonging.
2. Implement conflict resolution protocols and encourage open communication.
3. Improve documentation practices for better knowledge sharing.

#### Testing and Maintenance:
1. Increase test case coverage and implement automated testing frameworks.
2. Enhance code review processes and documentation for bug tracking and resolution.

#### Resources for Help:
1. Develop centralized resource repositories for easy access to learning materials.
2. Implement mentorship programs and encourage peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.

### Competitors for Analysis

1. **Github**
   - **Uniqueness:** Interactive between User and Developer.
   - **Advantages:** Connecting VSCode to GitHub account.
   - **Disadvantages:** Unknown tools e.g. need to learn how to use many tools/features.

2. **Notion**
   - **Uniqueness:** Has multiple formats that can take notes/track schedule.
   - **Advantages:** Notes are easily accessible regardless the device they are on.
   - **Disadvantages:** No offline access/limited capabilities.

3. **Slack**
   - **Uniqueness:** Directed and focused app versus like discord which is a way to communicate, but slack is more of a disciplined-oriented and professional app for productivity.
   - **Advantages:** Organizing information into different sections.
   - **Disadvantages:** Premium features cost money.

## Next Steps

The team will focus on creating Sketches with these ideas first drawing inspiration from both internal brainstorming and external competitor analysis. Regular assessments and adjustments will be made to ensure progress towards addressing the identified challenges. Then they will convert them to WireFrames in time for the Project Pitch, and then finally convert them to a High Fidelity Mockup. Meanwhile, the rest of the team will 
work on the Project Pitch Document before the Standup Meeting with Jash Makhija on Wednesday at 12:10pm.


## Conclusion

By focusing on continuity between work, developing a workflow, addressing personal issues and conflicts, improving testing and maintenance processes, and providing resources for help, the team aims to tackle key challenges in software development. The combination of internal brainstorming and competitor analysis provides a comprehensive approach to problem-solving, with the goal of enhancing productivity, collaboration, and overall project success.
