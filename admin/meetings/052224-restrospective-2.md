**What Went Well:**
1. **Organization**
   - we had better communication about what we know and what we need to do
2. **Productivity**
   - Always keep each other updated about the work progress and be willing to help each other by reviewing/commentating/editing the work
3. **Smaller Teams**
   - having separation of concerns and tasks
   - dedicated teams for each page/technology
4. **Technical**
   - creating a skeleton structure of the site and perfecting the looks (via figma)
  

**What Didn't Go Well:**
1. **Merge Conflicts**
   - CSS files colliding and creating small issues (git conflicts)
2. **Better planning ahead**
   - Team communication and also delegation of specific tasks
   - Could be more responsive and active on Slack
3. **HTML/CSS**
   - Fixing sizing/boxes
   - a few small styling issues
4. **Unforeseen Future Features**
   - Predicting future features that we will need for the skeleton
5. **Pull Request/Github Issues**
   - We could have been more descriptive on our pull request comments when reviewing
   - create pull request/issue templates
