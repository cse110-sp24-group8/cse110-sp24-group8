# Sprint Retrospective 1

- Getting everyone set up on Retrium
- SS will be sent later
- Saying what your strengths and weaknesses so each person can pick what they want to do/can understand better
- There wasn't distinct developers so we didn't communicate who was working on what, which led to two devs working on the same thing. Clarifying that will definitely increase efficiency. 
- Utilizing github issues will help identify who is doing what, and what tasks are being completed
- General idea of splitting the group work: Splitting up group based on group strengths and weaknesses which will balance each team out.
- Google form on strength and weaknesses will be sent out later, so groups will be formed based on that. 
- How often do we think we can meet? 
- Plan to meet again 5/1, and have some time to fill out forms for team distribution. More likely Wednesday night.
- Issues and commits were a bit too general, we need to be more specific in our commits
- We need to distribute more with our issues about what features we do. 
- During each meeting, say what each person is working on and create issues for each features
