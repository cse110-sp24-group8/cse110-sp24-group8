## 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
We have agreed to primarily communicate on Slack on our Team Channel ‘CSE 110 Project Team 8’. We are also going to decide a time for our Weekly Group Meetings with a [When2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?24655546-vtpff) starting Week 4.

## 3) Scheduling Meetings
Meeting times will be decided on overlapping times on When2meet. Slack will be used for communication. We are also open to in-person meetings and/or Zoom meetings (can switch every alternate week). We will also conduct a meeting a few days before the hard deadline to address any issues/checkup.

We have finalized for our team meetings to be on either Monday 9:30-10:30pm/Wednesday 12:00-1:00pm/Friday 3:15pm-4:15pm (we can change on a weekly basis depending upon the Assignment, Progress and Deadline).

## 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members
- Being responsible for their part of the work, ask for help whenever needed.
- Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Show up to meetings on time or if they can’t make it, send a heads-up.
- Ensure collaboration with team members to integrate all the aspects of the applications.
- Regularly check the communication channels and adhere to deadlines seriously.

## 5) Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines
- Kevin Kuang and Kaustubh Paliwal are Team 8’s leaders.
- Ulises Salinas Developer
- Brandon Luu Developer 
- Joshua Chen Developer 
- Nicholas Nguyen Developer
- Eric Huang Developer
- Arthur Cheung Designer 
- Samvathna Em Developer

## 6) Conflict Resolution
If conflicts were to occur, we would have a team vote to resolve them. However, if the issue was unresolved, we would consult with our TA for help. Some strategies to handle conflicts are:
- Encourage open and transparent communication among team members.
- Address conflicts as soon as they arise, rather than allowing them to escalate.
- Explore the root causes of the conflict and work towards finding mutually beneficial solutions.
- Once a resolution is reached, ensure that all parties involved agree to the solution.
- Outline the steps to escalate conflicts to higher levels of the teaching team or involve relevant stakeholders if necessary.

## 7) Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s
If a team member fails to fulfill their responsibilities/duties without notice, other members can report it to staff, but the team is still responsible for submitting a completed assignment at the end of the quarter. TA Jash Makhija is our direct communication with the course staff and will be in charge of approving the ideas, monitoring the progress of the Final Project, and resolving any team conflicts.
